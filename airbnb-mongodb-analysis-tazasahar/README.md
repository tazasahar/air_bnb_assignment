# AirBnB MongoDB Analysis

## Part 1
I munged the data by removing all of the columns except name, host_id, host_name, host_is_superhost, neighbourhood, neighbourhood_cleansed, beds, price, review_scores_ratings. 

## Part 2

1. show exactly two documents from the listings collection in any order

```js

//query
db.listings.find().limit(2) 

//results
{ "_id" : ObjectId("606ecfa97c6a86bb05a6f435"), "" : 0, "host_id" : 81292, "name" : "the OCEAN HAVEN - FREE wifi", "host_name" : "Laurel", "host_is_superhost" : "t", "neighbourhood" : "Fairhaven, Victoria, Australia", "neighbourhood_cleansed" : "Surf Coast", "beds" : 5, "price" : "$400.00", "review_scores_rating" : 98 }

{ "_id" : ObjectId("606ecfa97c6a86bb05a6f436"), "" : 1, "host_id" : 119103, "name" : "Executive residence peaceful locale", "host_name" : "Lynn", "host_is_superhost" : "f", "neighbourhood" : "Jan Juc, Victoria, Australia", "neighbourhood_cleansed" : "Surf Coast", "beds" : 6, "price" : "$500.00", "review_scores_rating" : 100 }

```
2. show exactly 10 documents in any order, but print in easier to read format and noting the host names for further use, using the pretty() function.

```js
//query
db.listings.find().limit(10).pretty();

//first two results
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("606ecfa97c6a86bb05a6f435"),
	"" : 0,
	"host_id" : 81292,
	"name" : "the OCEAN HAVEN - FREE wifi",
	"host_name" : "Laurel",
	"host_is_superhost" : "t",
	"neighbourhood" : "Fairhaven, Victoria, Australia",
	"neighbourhood_cleansed" : "Surf Coast",
	"beds" : 5,
	"price" : "$400.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 98
}
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("606ecfa97c6a86bb05a6f436"),
	"" : 1,
	"host_id" : 119103,
	"name" : "Executive residence peaceful locale",
	"host_name" : "Lynn",
	"host_is_superhost" : "f",
	"neighbourhood" : "Jan Juc, Victoria, Australia",
	"neighbourhood_cleansed" : "Surf Coast",
	"beds" : 6,
	"price" : "$500.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 100
}

```

3. choose two host_names who are superhosts (available in the host_is_superhost field), and show all of the listings offered by either of the two hosts
only show the name, price, neighbourhood, host_name, and host_is_superhost for each result

```js
//query
let fields_1 = {_id:0, "host_name":1, "host_id":1};
 db.listings.find({"host_is_superhost":"t"}, fields_1).limit(2).pretty();
//results
{ "host_id" : 81292, "host_name" : "Laurel" }
{ "host_id" : 1875131, "host_name" : "Charleson" }
```
I will now query the db to return all of the listings under the names Charlleson and Laurel 

```js
//query
let fields_2 = {_id:0, "host_name":1, "name":1, "price":1, "neighbourhood":1, "host_is_superhost":1};
db.listings.find({"host_id":{$in:[1875131,81292]}}, fields_2).limit(2).pretty();

//results
{
	"name" : "the OCEAN HAVEN - FREE wifi",
	"host_name" : "Laurel",
	"host_is_superhost" : "t",
	"neighbourhood" : "Fairhaven, Victoria, Australia",
	"price" : "$400.00"
}
{
	"name" : "Charleson Farm - rural luxury, breathtaking views",
	"host_name" : "Charleson",
	"host_is_superhost" : "t",
	"neighbourhood" : "Wensleydale, Victoria, Australia",
	"price" : "$476.00"
}

```

4. find ind all the unique host_name values (see the docs)

```js
//query 

db.listings.distinct('host_name')

// Sample result
[
"A Happy Dog",
	"Aaron",
	"Abbie",
	"Abraham",
	"Ada",
	"Adam",
	"Adam & Amanda",
	"Adele",
	"Adrian",
	"Adrienne",
	"Agnese",
	"Ailish",
	"Al",
	"Alan",
	"Alan & Christine",
	"Alan 老王",
]
```

5. find all of the places that have more than 2 beds in a neighborhood of your choice (referred to as neighbourhood_group_cleansed in the data file), ordered by review_scores_rating descending
* only show the name, beds, city, review_scores_rating, and price
* if you run out of memory for this query, try filtering review_scores_rating that aren't empty ($ne); and lastly, if there's still an issue, you can set the beds to match exactly 2

```js
//query
//specifying the return parameters
let fields_4 = {
    _id:0,
    "name":1,
    "beds":1,
    "review_scores_rating":1,
    "price":1
}
//find function
//neighborhood chosen: Surf Coast
db.listings.find({
    "beds":{$gt: 2}, "neighbourhood_cleansed":"Surf Coast","review_scores_rating": {$ne: ""}}, fields_4).sort({"review_scores_rating": -1}).pretty()

//sample results
{
	"name" : "Executive residence peaceful locale",
	"beds" : 6,
	"price" : "$500.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 100
}
{
	"name" : "Historic House with Sea Views",
	"beds" : 5,
	"price" : "$500.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 100
}
{
	"name" : "4 Bed, 2 Living Room Home overlooking Tree Tops",
	"beds" : 7,
	"price" : "$420.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 100
}
{
	"name" : "AireysEscape Coastal Heathlands Apt",
	"beds" : 3,
	"price" : "$198.00",
	"review_scores_rating" : 100
}

```

6. show the number of listings per host

```js
//query 
db.listings.aggregate([{$group: {_id: "$host_name", listingCount: {$sum: 1}}}])

//results
{ "_id" : "Reuben", "listingCount" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Alice & Stuart", "listingCount" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "April", "listingCount" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Chantelle And Andrew", "listingCount" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Caprice", "listingCount" : 2 }
{ "_id" : "Zane", "listingCount" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Omar", "listingCount" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Fitim", "listingCount" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "Vicky", "listingCount" : 1 }

```

7. In a particular neighborhood_group_cleansed of your choosing again, find the average review_scores_rating per neighborhood, and only show the ones above a 95, sorted in descending order of rating (see the docs)

```js
//query
db.listings.aggregate([
    {
        $group:
        {   
            _id:"$neighbourhood",
            avg_review:
                {
                    $avg:"$review_scores_rating"
                }
        }
    },
    {
        $project:
        { 
            "neighbourhood":1, 
            "avg_review":1,
        }
    },
    {
        $match:
        {
            "avg_review":{$gt:95}
        }
    },    
    {
        $sort:
        {
                "avg_review":-1
        }
    }
]);

//results

{ "_id" : "Heathmere, Victoria, Australia", "avg_review" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Paaratte, Victoria, Australia", "avg_review" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "St. Albans Park, Victoria, Australia", "avg_review" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Bushfield, Victoria, Australia", "avg_review" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Mortlake, Victoria, Australia", "avg_review" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Johanna, Vic, Australia", "avg_review" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Stonyford, Victoria, Australia", "avg_review" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Johanna, Australia", "avg_review" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Lovely Banks, Victoria, Australia", "avg_review" : 100 }

```
     }

## Part 3
This assignment deserves extra credit because I used pymongo to connect to the i6 mongo database and query then print the results. The file I used to do this can be found under py_to_mong.py in the main file directory.

## Report

The data set was retrieved from airbnb listings for Austrailia. The data source is from airbnb database and the link to the [airbnb_data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and it was in csv format.

Guests also have access to a private garage & guest parking making life a little easier.       |https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/c0dc4e9f-2ba2-4487-9842-410e3526ad25.jpg                                |173429646|https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/173429646|Sally - Airready                   |2018-02-14|Bells Beach, Victoria, Australia      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |within an hour    |100%              |92%                 |f                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/65ff9a4e-8a28-4a5c-bbfd-f445f4ca8a82.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/65ff9a4e-8a28-4a5c-bbfd-f445f4ca8a82.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium|                  |24                 |24                       |['email', 'phone', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual', 'work_email']|t                   |t                     |Jan Juc, Victoria, Australia      |Surf Coast            |                            |-38.3403 |144.31052|Entire house    |Entire home/apt|6           |         |2 baths       |3       |4   |["Dishes and silverware", "Garden or backyard", "Dryer", "Patio or balcony", "Heating", "Freezer", "Bed linens", "Smoke alarm", "Stove", "Private entrance", "Air conditioning", "TV", "Free street parking", "Barbecue utensils", "Essentials", "Nespresso machine", "Lockbox", "Shampoo", "Shower gel", "Hair dryer", "Kitchen", "Indoor fireplace", "BBQ grill", "Carbon monoxide alarm", "Cooking basics", "Oven", "Long term stays allowed", "Iron", "Microwave", "Hot water", "Wifi", "Free parking on premises", "Dishwasher", "Refrigerator", "Extra pillows and blankets", "Hangers", "Washer", "Luggage dropoff allowed"]                                                                                                                                                             |$286.00|2             |30            |2                     |4                     |1125                  |1125                  |2.2                   |1125.0                |                |t               |20             |50             |80             |329             |2021-02-27           |0                |0                    |0                     |            |           |                    |                      |                         |                     |                           |                      |                   |       |f               |15                            |15                                         |0                                           |0                                          |                 |
